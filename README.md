Notes for HLH dev:

This is just a somewhat rough & ready React.js page for capturing user inputs to replace the existing Patient Referral form (i.e. download fill out email back)

Doesn't Post the data anywhere (no destination yet)

Form.js and Form2.js are there just to illustrate layout options.

From brief Googling it looks relatively straightforward to integrate React frontend resources into WordPress (sorry if I threw a curveball, I've not worked with wordpress before).
